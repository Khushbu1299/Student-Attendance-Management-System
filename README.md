In Input class there are two methodes one is void subject and another one is void display. methode subject take name and attendance of students and there is a array named nameArray, which is used for taking name of 5 students and there are two subjects are enrolled for taking attendance which are java and operating system and there is nested switch case in this project for selecting subject and for marking present or absent of students.
